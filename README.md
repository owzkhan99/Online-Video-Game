Online Video Game Retailer: Ice
The perspective of the creator of this analysis is that of an employee of an online retailer called Ice. The company sells video games worldwide and is looking to be able to predict the next big sellers in video game titles.

This project is intended to take game sales data from 2016 and analyze it for useful information for making marketing decisions.

This project uses the following python libraries for analysis and visualization:

pandas as pd numpy as np seaborn as sns matplotlib.pyplot as plt

A hypothesis test was performed to compare user ratings on different video game platforms. HO: Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same. HA: Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are not the same.

Summary Conclusion: p-value: 3.0500850678177977e-05 We reject the null hypothesis

General Conclusion: In terms of how to deal with forecasting what games will sell best in the 2017 fiscal year, it is important to consider where each platform is within its sales lifecycle. Platforms tend to reach peak sales by about their 4th year in the market. They then trend down in the proceeding years as they are overtaken by the next generation platform or some other replacement. That being said, the PS4 is currently the leading platform in the NA and EU markets.

The 3DS is still selling in significant numbers in Japan, but has been trending down for the last several years. It would be best to focus on PS4 titles in the Japanese market for this reason, as a more current platform, there is more incentive for customers to buy newer titles and cutting edge features.

XBOX One is a fairly strong second to the PS4 in the NA and EU markets, but more resources should be allocated to the best performing PS4 platform. This is the same in Japan, where the strong legacy of the PS3 will likely lead to increased sales for the PS4 titles going forward. The Japanese market tends to hold on to platforms longer and will likely see increased adoption of the PS4 for the 2017 year.

Genre analysis found that Shooter and Action dominated sales in the NA and EU markets. Action has the highest overall sales, white Shooter genres have the highest average sales. Role-Playing is the clear leader for game genre in Japan.

Mature rated titles sell best in NA and EU. No significant findings on ESRB rating affecting sales in the Japanese market.
